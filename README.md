# getheight.py
### [much better name needed...]

Small code to measure the height of optically thick emission using the method presented in [Pinte et al. (2018a)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...609A..47P/abstract). Part of the code uses `detect_peaks.py` from [Marcos Duarte](https://github.com/demotu/BMC). For this to run you need the [imgcube](https://github.com/richteague/imgcube) package.

Working on functions to quickly fit powerlaw profiles or GP models to the data so you can plot something less noisy.
