    abstract = {The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) Large Program provides a detailed, high-resolution (∼10–20 au) view of molecular line emission in five protoplanetary disks at spatial scales relevant for planet formation. Here we present a systematic analysis of chemical substructures in 18 molecular lines toward the MAPS sources: IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480. We identify more than 200 chemical substructures, which are found at nearly all radii where line emission is detected. A wide diversity of radial morphologies—including rings, gaps, and plateaus—is observed both within each disk and across the MAPS sample. This diversity in line emission profiles is also present in the innermost 50 au. Overall, this suggests that planets form in varied chemical environments both across disks and at different radii within the same disk. Interior to 150 au, the majority of chemical substructures across the MAPS disks are spatially coincident with substructures in the millimeter continuum, indicative of physical and chemical links between the disk midplane and warm, elevated molecular emission layers. Some chemical substructures in the inner disk and most chemical substructures exterior to 150 au cannot be directly linked to dust substructure, however, which indicates that there are also other causes of chemical substructures, such as snowlines, gradients in UV photon fluxes, ionization, and radially varying elemental ratios. This implies that chemical substructures could be developed into powerful probes of different disk characteristics, in addition to influencing the environments within which planets assemble.

    title = {Molecules with {ALMA} at Planet-forming Scales. {XX}. The Massive Disk around {GM} Aurigae},
    abstract = {Gas mass remains one of the most difficult protoplanetary disk properties to constrain. With much of the protoplanetary disk too cold for the main gas constituent, H2, to emit, alternative tracers such as dust, CO, or the H2 isotopologue HD are used. However, relying on disk mass measurements from any single tracer requires assumptions about the tracer’s abundance relative to H2 and the disk temperature structure. Using new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations from the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program as well as archival ALMA observations, we construct a disk physical/chemical model of the protoplanetary disk GM Aur. Our model is in good agreement with the spatially resolved CO isotopologue emission from 11 rotational transitions with spatial resolution ranging from 0.″15 to 0.″46 (24–73 au at 159 pc) and the spatially unresolved HD J = 1–0 detection from Herschel. Our best-fit model favors a cold protoplanetary disk with a total gas mass of approximately 0.2 M ⊙, a factor of 10 reduction in CO gas inside roughly 100 au and a factor of 100 reduction outside of 100 au. Despite its large mass, the disk appears to be on the whole gravitationally stable based on the derived Toomre Q parameter. However, the region between 70 and 100 au, corresponding to one of the millimeter dust rings, is close to being unstable based on the calculated Toomre Q of <1.7.

    title = {Molecules with {ALMA} at Planet-forming Scales ({MAPS}). X. Studying Deuteration at High Angular Resolution toward Protoplanetary Disks},
    abstract = {Deuterium fractionation is dependent on various physical and chemical parameters. Thus, the formation location and thermal history of material in the solar system is often studied by measuring its D/H ratio. This requires knowledge about the deuteration processes operating during the planet formation era. We aim to study these processes by radially resolving the DCN/HCN (at 0.″3 resolution) and N2D+/N2H+ (∼0.″3–0.″9) column density ratios toward the five protoplanetary disks observed by the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming scales (MAPS) Large Program. DCN is detected in all five sources, with one newly reported detection. N2D+ is detected in four sources, two of which are newly reported detections. We derive column density profiles that allow us to study the spatial variation of the DCN/HCN and N2D+/N2H+ ratios at high resolution. DCN/HCN varies considerably for different parts of the disks, ranging from 10−3 to 10−1. In particular, the inner-disk regions generally show significantly lower HCN deuteration compared with the outer disk. In addition, our analysis confirms that two deuterium fractionation channels are active, which can alter the D/H ratio within the pool of organic molecules. N2D+ is found in the cold outer regions beyond ∼50 au, with N2D+/N2H+ ranging between 10−2 and 1 across the disk sample. This is consistent with the theoretical expectation that N2H+ deuteration proceeds via the low-temperature channel only.
